Description:
This is a basic attempt at trying to bring the simplicity of GORM (from Grails) to PHP.

No XML files, no INI config files - everything should be deduced from looking at domain 
models, determining relationships, building SQL, with sensible defaults.

Demo usage:
From the command line, run 
>php tables.php

This will dump the create statements for the domain objects listed in /domain

Run those in MySQL (hardcoded to mysql right now as a first pass)

Now run 
>php index.php


The index file above, condensed, looks like this:

	$p = new Person(array("name"=>"mike")); 
	$p->save();
	$pr = new Profile(array("email"=>"mike@kimsal.com","cellPhone"=>"123456789"));
	$pr->save();
	$p->add_to_profile($pr);
	$p->save();
	$b = new Book(array("title"=>"mike's book", "isbn"=>"12355"));
	$b->save();
	$b2 = new Book(array("title"=>"mike's book #2", "isbn"=>"w4243"));
	$b2->save();
	echo "person has ".count($p->books)." books\n";
	$p->add_to_books($b);
	echo "person has ".count($p->books)." books\n";
	$p->add_to_books($b2);
	echo "person has ".count($p->books)." books\n";
	$p->debug();


This will output something like:

person has 0 books
person has 1 books
person has 2 books
