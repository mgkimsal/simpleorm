Description:
This is a basic attempt at trying to bring the simplicity of GORM (from Grails) to PHP.

No XML files, no INI config files - everything should be deduced from looking at domain 
models, determining relationships, building SQL, with sensible defaults.

Demo usage:
From the command line, run 
>php tables.php

This will dump the create statements for the domain objects listed in /domain

Run those in MySQL (hardcoded to mysql right now as a first pass)

Now run 
>php index.php

This will output something like:

person has 0 books
adding book id 17 to person 10
person has 1 books
adding book id 18 to person 10
person has 1 books
